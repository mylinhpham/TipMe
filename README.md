## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- A challenge that I faced while making the app was that I have a beginner level of understanding of how to use Xcode and Swift so when writing the code, the syntax was a 
little hard to get around at first. But in the end, I got through it and was able to make the app work.
